# 🎄 Advent of Code

Welcome to my (laughable) attempts at solving the daily puzzles from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)! This repository is a chronicle of my journey to improve my coding skills while embracing the festive coding spirit. 🎅

## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual event where programming enthusiasts solve daily puzzles from December 1st to December 25th. Each day features a unique challenge, with two parts to complete, testing problem-solving skills and logic.

It's a fun and educational way to get better at programming, explore new languages, and see how others approach the same problems.

## 🎯 My Goals

-   Learn TypeScript: Advent of Code is my playground for learning TypeScript and its quirks (non-null assertions, anyone?).
-   Avoid Brute Force: A questionable commitment to finding “elegant” solutions... at least until frustration sets in.
-   Have Fun: It's about the journey, not the leaderboard!

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/VikramSinghMTL/advent-of-code.git
cd advent-of-code
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. Run a specific day's solution:

```
npx tsx YYYY/DD/0X.ts
```

Where YYYY is the year, DD is the day, and X is either 1 or 2 for the puzzle number.
